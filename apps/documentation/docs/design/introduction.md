# Introduction

ECC Design is a utility library for the components of ECC. It provides a set of low-level utility components that are used by other packages in ECC.

> **Note:** This package is not intended to be used directly by the end user.

## Goals

- Having a single source of truth for the components used in ECC component suite. This enables us to have a consistent look and feel across all the components.
- This package also allows end user to customize the components to suit their needs centrally.
- To provide standard developer experience (DX) for building components for their cloud services.
