# Task Execution Service Components

Easily reusable, customizable and framework agnostic Web components for [TES](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/blob/develop/openapi/task_execution_service.openapi.yaml) GA4GH API. The Task Execution Service (TES) API is an effort to define a standardized schema and API for describing batch execution tasks. A task defines a set of input files, a set of (Docker) containers and commands to run, a set of output files, and some other logging and metadata.

This package provides a collection of Web Components for interacting with TES API. It offers functionalities for listing, creating, and deleting task runs. These components facilitate seamless integration and enhanced user experience when working with TES tasks.
