# Start you _dev_ environment

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

> Note: All of the following commands should be executed on all the packages & apps. In case you want to execute the script on any one particular app/package, you can define the [workspace tag](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/package-installation#addingremovingupgrading-packages) along with any of the below commands like `-w=ecc-utils-design`.

1. Install the dependencies involved by running the following command:

   ```bash copy
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server by running the following command:

   ```bash copy
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server on your local machine and allow you to start working on the project.

3. If you want to start a new package run:

   ```bash copy
   npm run new
   ```

4. Run linter by the following command:

   ```bash copy
   npm run lint
   ```

5. Run all test using the following command.

   ```bash copy
   npm run test
   ```

> Note: Since packages have interdependency, you need to run `dev` script at least once before running `lint` and `test` scripts globally.
