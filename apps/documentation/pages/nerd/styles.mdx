# ECC Styles

## How are the styles extensible?

ECC's `cloud-components` can be customized using two key features, these should be properly integrated while creating a new package.

### CSS Parts

`CSS` of `Web Components` are isolated within its `shadowdom`, but `cloud-components` expose essential CSS classes and Ids using `CSS parts` so that styles from outside the components can be applied to it. If a component relies on another Web Components, it exports its CSS parts as well so they can be accessed and modified for the said component.

<code>Lets create a new component in ecc package</code>
```ts
...
export class ECCMyComp{
    // declare props
    // declare methods
    return html`<div class="my-first-part" part="my-first-part">
            <my-external-dep exportpart="my-external-part">
            </my-external-dep>
        </div>`
}
...
```
<code>Now this component's style can be extended as</code>
```html
...
<!-- import ecc-my-comp-->
<style>
    ecc-my-comp::part(my-first-part){
    /*my new style for the component*/
    }
    ecc-my-comp::part(my-external-part){
    /*my new style for the component's external dep*/
    }
</style>
<ecc-my-comp></ecc-my-comp>
...
```

### CSS variables

Since `cloud-components` leverage shoelace components, it extends those variable, these variable can be overwritten in the root selector of CSS. Read more [here](https://shoelace.style/getting-started/customizing/).

## Workspaces and scripts

You can run any command for the entire repo or do it for a specific package. Read the turbo docs for that. Read about workspaces and some common scripts [here](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/cloud-components#getting-started).
