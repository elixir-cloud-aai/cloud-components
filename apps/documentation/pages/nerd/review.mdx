# Developers Docs

Guide to development of `ecc cloud components`.

## Web Components

Web Components are reusable pieces of code that can be embedded in any web page. ECC's `cloud component` aims to be highly customizable on many levels such as styles and configurations. These component are be framework agnostic supporting all the major web frameworks.
For more reference read [webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebComponents/).

## Monorepo

`cloud-components` uses a monorepo approach, the project is setup using [turborepo](https://turbo.build/).
Below is the a brief explanation of needs/roles of different directories and files.

```

|   |                           // use the command `npm run new` in root directory.

ECC package follow develop on best practices for development based on [open WC](https://open-wc.org/).

## People of interests

There are two important perspective for development of ecc cloud components:

### package-author

The one that authors the package. At this level keep in mind the level of abstractions, as abstraction comes at the cost of granular control. Packages must be developed such that all the abstractions don't take away the core need of the app-author.

### app-author

The one who uses the package to customize them if need be (_non programmatically_) and use them to develop their own app/website. `app-author` should be give _just_ enough `APIs` that the packages meet the need of being highly customizable. APIs for the web components is managed by `package-author` with this is consideration.

All the packages will leverage `design package` and UI library ([shoelace](http://shoelace.style/)) for there specific use case. If a UI component is not available `package-author` implements the UI component in design packages.

```mermaid
