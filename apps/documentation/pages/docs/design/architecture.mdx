# Component Architecture

Components in the `@elixir-cloud/design` package are built with a slot-based architecture and expose CSS parts for styling. This approach, inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), provides a powerful and flexible way to customize the look and feel of each component.

## Design Philosophy

Our customization approach focuses on:

- **Component Parts**: Each component is carefully divided into logical parts that can be styled independently.
- **Minimalism**: Only the most essential parts of a component are exposed for styling. This makes customization intuitive and prevents overwhelming developers with too many options.
- **Encapsulation**: Styles are scoped to specific parts, preventing unintended side effects and ensuring that customizations don't leak outside the component's boundaries.

This architecture makes it easy to precisely target and style specific elements of a component.

## CSS Parts

All components in the `@elixir-cloud/design` package expose a `base` part on their main wrapper element. You can target this with the `::part(base)` pseudo-element in your CSS.

### The `part="base"` Pattern

Here is a basic example of how to customize the `ecc-utils-design-button` component:

```css
/* Style all button components */
ecc-utils-design-button::part(base) {
  font-weight: 600;
  letter-spacing: 0.025em;
  border-radius: var(--ecc-radius); /* Use global tokens */
}

/* Style specific button variants */
ecc-utils-design-button[variant="destructive"]::part(base) {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b6b 0%, #d92e2e 100%);
  color: white;
  border: none;
}
```

### Component-Specific Parts

For more complex components, additional parts may be exposed to allow for more granular control. For example, the `ecc-utils-design-table` component exposes several parts:

```css
/* Table component parts */
ecc-utils-design-table::part(base) { /* The main table container */
  border-color: var(--ecc-accent);
}

ecc-utils-design-table-header::part(base) { /* A header row */
  background-color: var(--ecc-accent);
  color: var(--ecc-accent-foreground);
}

ecc-utils-design-table-cell::part(base) { /* An individual cell */
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

You can inspect each component in your browser's developer tools to see which parts are available for styling.

### Benefits of the Parts System

Following the principles from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), our component architecture provides:

1.  **Precise Control**: Target exactly the element you want to style.
2.  **Maintainability**: A clear separation between a component's internal structure and its presentation.
3.  **Flexibility**: Combine CSS parts with global design tokens for powerful and consistent theming.
