# Introduction

The `@elixir-cloud/design` package is a foundational utility library that powers the ELIXIR Cloud Component's (ECC) ecosystem. It provides a suite of low-level utility components that serve as building blocks for higher-level packages in the ECC suite.

These components establish a unified design system, enable customization, and standardize the development process for cloud service components.

## Installation

</Callout>

Design Components can be used in any web application through various installation methods (like npm, cdn, etc.). The package is published as `@elixir-cloud/design` with the service name `design`.

For detailed instructions on how to install and set up the Design Components in your project, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/installation).

## Overview

### Why Design Package?

The Design package serves three core objectives:

1. **Unified Design**: It establishes a single source of truth for ECC components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire ECC suite.

2. **Customization**: The package empowers end-users to tailor components to their specific needs, offering centralized customization options for all ECC components in one place. [Learn more about customization](/docs/customization).

3. **Developer-Centric Standardization**: By streamlining the development process for cloud service components, the Design package provides a consistent and intuitive developer experience (DX).

By leveraging the Design package, developers can create cohesive, customizable, and standardized components for the ECC ecosystem more efficiently.
