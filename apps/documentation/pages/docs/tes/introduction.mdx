# Introduction

The `@elixir-cloud/tes` package provides a suite of Web Components designed to interact with the [Task Execution Service (TES)](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/) API.
These components offer a user-friendly interface for managing task runs within cloud environments.

These components provide functionalities for listing, creating, and deleting task runs, making it easier to manage and monitor task executions.

## Installation

TES Components can be used in any web application through various installation methods (like npm, cdn, etc.). The package is published as `@elixir-cloud/tes` with the service name `tes`.

For detailed instructions on how to install and set up the TES Components in your project, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/installation).

## Overview

### What is TES?

The Task Execution Service (TES) API is an effort to define a standardized schema and API for describing batch execution tasks.
A task defines a set of input files, a set of (Docker) containers and commands to run, a set of output files, and some other logging and metadata.

For a deeper understanding of TES and its implementations, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/)
and explore the [proTES](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/proTES) for various use cases and implementations.
