## Overview

### What is WES?

The Workflow Execution Service API describes a standard programmatic way to run and manage workflows. Having this standard API supported by multiple execution engines will let people run the same workflow using various execution platforms running on various clouds/environments.

For further exploration and development with WES, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-service-schemas) and
check out the [WES Starter Kit](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/WES-starter-kit) for a quick setup of a local WES environment.
