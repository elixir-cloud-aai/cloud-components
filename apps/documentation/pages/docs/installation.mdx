# Installation

You can install the ELIXIR Cloud Components (ECC) package via your favorite package manager or use the CDN installation method.

<Callout type='info'>
  <div class='text-sm'>
    The following examples uses `service-name` as a placeholder. Replace it with the desired service
    name of your use case. You can find the list of available services in the [Supported
    Services](/docs/introduction#supported-services) section.
  </div>
</Callout>

## Package Manager

To integrate ECC into your project, install the desired package using your preferred package manager. This is the recommended method for most projects.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy /(service-name)/
    npm i @elixir-cloud/(service-name)
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy /(service-name)/
    yarn add @elixir-cloud/(service-name)
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy /(service-name)/
    pnpm i @elixir-cloud/(service-name)
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## CDN

If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can include the ECC components directly in your HTML file using a CDN. This method is suitable when you don't want to manage dependencies or while using vanilla HTML/JavaScript.

Paste the following script tag into your HTML file to include the ECC components:

```html copy /(service-name)/
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@elixir-cloud/(service-name)/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
