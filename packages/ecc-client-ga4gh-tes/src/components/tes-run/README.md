# ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-run

The `ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-run` component is an integral part of the `ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-runs` component, which is used for listing [TES](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas) tasks in a paginated manner. The `ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-run` component serves as an individual item within the task list, providing additional functionality for displaying and managing detailed information about a specific task.

When rendered within the `ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-runs` component, each instance of `ecc-client-ga4gh-tes-run` represents a single task. By default, it displays essential task details such as the `task ID` and its current `state`. However, when clicked or expanded, the component expands to reveal a comprehensive view of the task, showcasing additional information such as task execution progress, associated metadata, and any relevant details related to the task's execution environment.

This expandable functionality allows users to conveniently access more comprehensive information about a specific task without overwhelming the task list view. By collapsing the expanded view, users can regain a concise overview of the task list, with only the `task ID` and `state` visible. This feature improves the user experience by offering a balance between displaying essential information and providing detailed insights on-demand.
